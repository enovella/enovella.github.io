`2015-2018` (3 years 2mo)
__Riscure__, Delft, The Netherlands

Security Analyst
- *Keywords*: Android reverse engineer for Cloud-based payments apps (HCE) and DRM (Pay-TV), whitebox cryptography, Frida & Unicorn emulator, mPOS, Pay-TV,
            DRM reverse-engineering, secure boot, fault injection, glitching, source code review, embedded security, obfuscation, TEE, ARM & MIPS exploitation,
            side channels, smart-meters, modems, javacard & smartcards

Performing security evaluations for various products in the mobile payment and content
protection markets. Concretely, evaluating satellite receivers (Pay-TV), Digital Right Management
systems and Android mobile payment applications (mainly Host Card Emulation). My regular work
consists of performing dynamic binary instrumentation and evaluating the security mechanisms
(anti -root,-debugging,-emulation,…) on Android mobile banking apps. One of my goals is to
deobfuscate binary code and fight against packers. In addition I assess the robustness of
the architecture design and attempt to break the security of obfuscated ciphers implemented
in software also known as White-box cryptography. Occasionally I evaluate MicroSoft PlayReady
certifications on the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) area where the main goal is to find
memory corruption bugs and exploit them until gaining code execution. Another of my skills is
in reviewing the hardware and software security of gas smart meters, modems and any other
embedded device which may come into my hands.

`2014-2015` (7mo)
__Fox-IT__, Delft, The Netherlands

Intern. Masters Thesis; "Hardware Reverse-engineering"
- *Keywords*: Hardware reverse engineering, wirelessHART protocol, SCADA security, wireless sensor networks, industrial systems,
              JTAG, SPI sniffing, firmware dumping, OpenOCD, flashtool, Bus pirate

Internship investigating wireless SCADA devices to extract the cryptographic keys by applying
hardware attacks.

`2006-2011` __WiFiSlaX__, SeguridadWireless, Spain

Collaborator

Description: Our main goal was to create a kind of BackTrack distribution mainly focused on wireless
hacking technology. During those years, I was reverse engineering some routers of important
ISP’s and sniffing around with devices on 2.4Ghz. Also, I installed tools and tailored Linux
distributions just for fun

### Interests and Hobbies

I love all sports but I mostly prefer swimming and chess. Enjoy reading technical about
programming, reverse engineering, exploiting, vulnerabilities and so on. Play hacking contests
whenever I have some spare time. Know how to repair computers. Besides computers, I also
love nature a lot.
